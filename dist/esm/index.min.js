 * THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 * COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 * COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 * AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 * 
 * BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 * TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 * BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 * CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 * CONDITIONS.
 * 
 * 1. Definitions
 * 
 *  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and

 *     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
 *     recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
 *     derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
 *     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
 *     this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
 *     work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
 *     timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
 *     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

 *     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
 *     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
 *     in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and
 *     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
 *     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
 *     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
 *     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
 *     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
 *     considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
 *     License.
 *  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
 *     copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
 *     other transfer of ownership.

 *     musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
 *     play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
 *     expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer

 *     of this License including without limitation any production in the
 *     literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
 *     form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
 *     pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
 *     of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
 *     choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
 *     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
 *     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;

 *     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
 *     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
 *     extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
 *     a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
 *     considered a literary or artistic work.

 *     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
 *     respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
 *     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
 *     violation.
 *  i. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
 *     to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
 *     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital

 *     medium.
 * 
 * 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 * limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 * limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 * copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 * 
 * 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 * Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 * perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 * exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 * 
 *  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 *     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 *     Collections;
 *  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
 *     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
 *     clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
 *     to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
 *     original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
 *     modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 *  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
 *     in Collections; and,
 *  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 * 
 * The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 * known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 * such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 * other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
 * granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the
 * rights described in Section 4(e).
 * 
 * 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 * subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 * 
 *  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
 *     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
 *     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
 *     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
 *     on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
 *     the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
 *     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
 *     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
 *     to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
 *     Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
 *     Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
 *     measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
 *     Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
 *     the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
 *     incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
 *     apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
 *     License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
 *     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
 *     as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an
 *     Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 *     practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
 *     Section 4(d), as requested.
 *  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)
 *     the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
 *     the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
 *     jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
 *     contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
 *     Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable License").
 *     You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
 *     every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You
 *     may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
 *     terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
 *     Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
 *     terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
 *     refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
 *     with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
 *     Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
 *     Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
 *     measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
 *     the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
 *     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
 *     applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
 *     does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
 *     made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 *  c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
 *     above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
 *     commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
 *     the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
 *     or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
 *     toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
 *     there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
 *     the exchange of copyrighted works.
 *  d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
 *     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 *     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 *     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 *     name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 *     and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
 *     or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 *     attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 *     terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
 *     or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
 *     extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
 *     specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
 *     refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
 *     and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
 *     a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
 *     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
 *     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
 *     this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
 *     provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
 *     a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
 *     authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
 *     credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
 *     other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
 *     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
 *     in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
 *     License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
 *     connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
 *     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
 *     use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
 *     permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
 *     Parties.
 *  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 * 
 *      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 *         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
 *         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
 *         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
 *         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
 *     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 *         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
 *         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves
 *         the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
 *         You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of
 *         such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
 *         noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives
 *         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
 *         licensing scheme; and,
 *    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
 *         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
 *         Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
 *         voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
 *         by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a
 *         purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
 *         under Section 4(c).
 *  f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 *     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 *     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
 *     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
 *     take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
 *     prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
 *     agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
 *     of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
 *     make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
 *     modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
 *     Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
 *     as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
 *     applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
 *     right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
 *     but not otherwise.
 * 
 * 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 * 
 * UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE
 * FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
 * AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
 * WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 * LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 * PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 * ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 * DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 * WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 * 
 * 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 * LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 * ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 * ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 * BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 * 
 * 7. Termination
 * 
 *  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 *     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
 *     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
 *     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
 *     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
 *     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
 *     survive any termination of this License.
 *  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
 *     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 *     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
 *     Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
 *     any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
 *     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
 *     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
 *     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
 *     stated above.
 * 
 * 8. Miscellaneous
 * 
 *  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
 *     the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
 *     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 *  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
 *     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
 *     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 *  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 *     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 *     the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 *     by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 *     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 *     enforceable.
 *  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 *     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 *     and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 *  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
 *     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 *     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 *     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 *     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 *     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 *  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
 *     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
 *     for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
 *     September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
 *     Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
 *     and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
 *     These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
 *     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
 *     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
 *     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
 *     standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
 *     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
 *     additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
 *     License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
 *     applicable law.
